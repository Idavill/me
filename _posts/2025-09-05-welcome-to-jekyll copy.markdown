`An audiovisual journey into the rhythms of plant life
Step into the garden and leave the noise of the festival behind for a moment. Meditation on Matter invites you to slow down and reconnect with your senses through a guided audiovisual meditation inspired by the quiet intelligence of plant life and all that sustains it.
Drift through a living collage of textures and tones: whispers of soil, rustling leaves, distant water – field recordings and 3D scans gathered from real landscapes and arranged into an ambient world of stillness and growth.
Taste the garden’s offerings, sip herbal tea, and let your awareness settle into the present.
Forget your FOMO. Bring a friend, breathe deeply, and return to the grounding rhythm of simply being.`
