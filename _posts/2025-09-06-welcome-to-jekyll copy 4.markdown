IdeaDots is a visual brainstorming tool built with Python and React. In this application, ideas can be placed in 3D space and explored through various views. The app is designed to support client conversations and rapid iteration, allowing designers to bypass traditional modeling while maintaining an open and abstract approach to exploring possibilities.

While the images primarily showcase interior concepts, the app can also be used to investigate materials, fa√ßade cladding, or support the documentation phase of a restoration project.

`All ideas are gathered in notebook mapped to 3D location`
